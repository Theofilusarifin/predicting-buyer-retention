# Predicting-Buyer-Retention-to-Evaluate-Campaign-Effectiveness-at-Shopee-Indonesia

## Background

Here at Shopee Indonesia we run a lot of campaigns every single day. But, which campaigns bring more high-quality buyers? Is it only temporarily attracting new buyers which will churn after the campaigns are over? In this case, you are asked to create a machine learning model to predict whether a new buyer will later become a retained buyer or not according to their behavior in their first two weeks using our platform. Therefore we could assess whether a certain campaign is drawing more retained buyers or not.
